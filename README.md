# KEY INSIGHTS
1. Genre Popularity & Vote Count Correlation

A strong correlation exists between vote count and popularity score, suggesting that genres with higher vote counts tend to be more popular.

- English (10,789 movies)
- Japanese (262 movies)
- Spanish (323 movies)

3. Trends in Movie Production & Revenue

The highest number of movies (510) was produced between 2014 and 2022.
However, the period between 1993 and 2013 recorded the highest total revenue, amounting to $21.52 billion.

4.  Disparity Between Highest-Grossing & Most Profitable Movies

It holds the top position in both the most profitable and highest-grossing movie categories.
However, not all top-grossing movies ranked among the most profitable, and even those that appeared in both lists held different positions in each ranking.

5. Budget vs. Revenue & Budget vs. Profit Correlation

The lack of a direct correlation between budget and revenue as well as budget and profit explains why some of the highest-grossing movies are not necessarily the most profitable.

6. Vote Count vs. Financial Success

The top 5 most voted movies were entirely different from the highest-grossing and most profitable movies, except for It, which was the only film to appear in all three categories.


# RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Leverage Popular Genres for Success

Since Horror/Thriller movies dominate in popularity, studios and streaming platforms should invest more in these genres to attract audiences and drive engagement.
Marketing strategies should emphasize vote count engagement, as higher votes correlate with increased popularity.


2. Language-Specific Content Strategies

Given that English, Japanese, and Spanish movies dominate, studios should prioritize global distribution in these languages.
Streaming platforms should expand localization efforts (subtitles, dubbing) to capture diverse audiences.


3. Targeted Movie Release Timing

While 2014-2022 saw the highest number of movies, the 1993-2013 period generated the most revenue.
Studios should analyze release strategies to identify what factors contributed to past financial success and optimize future releases.


4. Balancing High Revenue & Profitability

Since not all highest-grossing movies are the most profitable, studios should focus on cost-effective production strategies to maximize profit.
A large budget does not guarantee profitability, so careful financial planning is crucial.


5. Understanding Budget vs. Profit & Revenue Relationships

Since there is no direct correlation between budget and revenue or profit, producers should not assume higher budgets will yield greater returns.
Instead, they should assess past movie performances to allocate budgets more efficiently.


6. Audience Engagement Over Financial Success

The most voted movies differ from the highest-grossing and most profitable ones, meaning audience approval doesn’t always translate into financial success.
Studios should consider both critical reception and audience engagement when planning marketing and distribution strategies.
